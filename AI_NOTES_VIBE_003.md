### scene essence

turn image into translation, into prompt, into text,

Analyze this image at an expert level by deconstructing its essence into core themes, emotions, symbolic meaning, and narrative context. Identify visual elements such as subject focus, composition, perspective, depth of field, lighting, color grading, texture, and motion cues. Translate this analysis into a fully detailed prompt that integrates both creative descriptors and technical cinematography directions (e.g., camera angle, lens type, framing, lighting setup, atmosphere, and post-processing style). The final prompt should be optimized so that any image generation platform can reproduce the image with high fidelity, while preserving its emotional impact, stylistic nuances, and symbolic resonance. Something like [Themes] + [Camera Setup] + [Lighting] + [Emotion] + [Symbolism])

GET RESULTING DESCRIPTOIN, create NEW PICTURE, go across tools.

"EXTRACT ESSENCE" - into TXT.

### scene ideation

deep understanding - priming CONTEXT WINDOW.
emotionally charged, socially resonant, visually captivating.

Upload extracted scene essence into a LLM with the following prompt: Please use the following data and the image provided to get a good deep understanding of the images to leverage in next step
Then ask it: Can you create five powerful prompts that generate different scenes from the image—woven together into an epic movie trailer? The trailer should feel like a film produced by John Singleton or Spike Lee: emotionally charged, socially resonant, and visually captivating. Each scene prompt should build on the last, forming a cohesive, five-part sequence that conveys both depth and cinematic intensity.Please provide the five-scene set in batches of five at a time, with expert-level camera direction, emotional control, and narrative flow—crafted to feel like a true trailer for a groundbreaking film.
Ask it to: rank the ideas on 7 measures each out of ten then normalize for a overall score out of 100
Then finally ask it to: Generate 10 ideas better the rest
