Inside the blackbox.

Predicting a triangle (visually) with probability between 0 / 1.

discriminative AI of many features to small features.

Prompt completion.

distribution sampling - unpredictability.

dice roll inside blackbox. Every time unique answer.

token predicts next token.

Next word score. 

### TRANSLATION - TEXT to SPEECH.

source language input

target language output

encoder - take input sequence = generate representation.

capture useful information in tokens.

pass tokens to decoder,

input sentence to many tokens.

Traditional RNN.

Attention mechanism allows encoder to pay more 

attention to every token - not just one.

Output - generate waveform (audio token).

Generator Network. 1 token is 3ms. = 4 token 12ms.
