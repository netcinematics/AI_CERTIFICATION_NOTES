# week 2

## mcp
Dr Tom Yeh AI by Hand

Larissa Schwartz sam Cummings 

Model context protocol mcp

### No external ability 

Cannot access internet.

### external capability

LLM with external comms

### why

2 or 3 LLMs in app

Calendar db etc

Mcp connects together. Direct to tools and resources. Mcp servers are unified resources, standardized resources.

Mcp http client server
LLM Host client 
LLM apps to access data with mcp
Ides APIs 

Control tower.

Local or remote process

Connected 
Primitives: tools resources prompts
Code repo.

Server xposes
Client invoke query interpolate

Tools tunctions
Resources read only.
Prompts.

Declare tool as fn in Python

Decorator

Resources
Direct and templated
@mcp.resource static
@mcp.templated params dynamic

### PROMPT 

Predefined to server

@mcp.prompt ( agent )

### client server API

Init udp req resp and init

Message notification 

Transport wrapper 

Streamable stdio or sse

Stateful or stateless

### use case

Query to mcp client
Breaks into steps
Task a and b
Needs external req resp from mcp
Which services
List of tools
Query with context. 
LLM decides tool to task within context.
Resources is data lookup
Tools is for action

Asynchronous tasks run in parallel.

Not always sequential.

Response back to LLM to decode

JSON rpc
