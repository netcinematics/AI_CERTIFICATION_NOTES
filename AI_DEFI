LangGraph?
pillars of infrastructure 
1. model selection
small models for routing
large for reasoning plan deep research 
open models? gemma 3
2. OPTIMIZE 
mcts: monte carlo tree search
more time to think
repeated or sequence sample.
expand exploration 
or a deeper exploitation
mcp for agent to agent 
3. cost
small llm for easy 
llm for complex reason
deactivate thinking mode 
4. availability 
multiple agent tasks gpu
orchestra kubernetes or ray
agent deployment 
5. security 
isolate code from host
sanitize data
human in loop hitl
detect block some prompts 
lang graph approve reject
6. monitor production 
metrics throughput 
7. tools
langfuse
langsmith
LangChain 
langgraph
langserve
tgi
whole system backtrace and
7. benchmarks.
macine learning task lifecycle 
8. infrastructure 
OPTIMIZE runtime vllm
### ROADMAP 
structured workflow of complex problem
1. state agent tool use
2 cot react
3. multiagent swarm supervisor heirarchy 

### checklist
circuit breaker, non infinite loop
local memory 

### pitfalls
routing checkpoints budget control
loops if reasoning on llm

concepts into impact, in prod.
