GOOGLE_AGENTIC_DAY_5:

whitepaper provides a technical guide to the operational lifecycle of AI agents, 

focusing on deployment, scaling and productionization. 

It explores the challenges of transitioning agentic systems from prototypes to 

enterprise-grade solutions, with special attention to A2A Protocol.  

codelabs, how to build systems of multiple, independent agents that can 

communicate and collaborate using A2A Protocol. 

You'll also learn how to take your agent from your local machine to a 

production-ready, scalable service, by deploying your agent to 

Vertex AI Agent Engine on Google Cloud.
