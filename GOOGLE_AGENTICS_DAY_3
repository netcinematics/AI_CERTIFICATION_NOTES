Day 3 (Context Engineering: Sessions & Memory)
Welcome to Day 3.

This whitepaper explores context engineering as the 
practice of dynamically assembling and managing information within an 
agent's context window to create 
stateful and personalized Al experiences. It defines 
Sessions as the container for a single, 
immediate conversation's history, and 
Memory as the long-term persistence mechanism.

In the codelabs, you will learn how to make 
agents stateful by managing conversation history through 
context engineering in ADK, and working memory within a 
session, allowing your agent to remember 
context and have coherent, multi-turn conversations. In the second 
notebook, you'll give your agent 
long-term memory that persists across different sessions.

 whitepaper explores the critical role of 
Sessions and Memory in building 
stateful, intelligent LLM agents to empower developers to create more powerful, 
personalized, and persistent AI experiences. To enable Large Language Models 
(LLMs) to remember, learn, and personalize interactions, developers must 
dynamically assemble and manage information within their 
context window—a process known as Context Engineering.

1 context engineer (foundation)
  - stateless to statefulness
  - adapt to input, manage data
  - few-shot reasoning
  - context rot (dynamic history mutation)
  1. get memories
  2. block items
  3. session data
  4. update long term memory 

2 sessions interactions 
   - session object
   - mutability, summary 
   - MAS (multi-agent systems)
   - all write to same log.
   - blackbox isolation.
    - framework agnostic.
