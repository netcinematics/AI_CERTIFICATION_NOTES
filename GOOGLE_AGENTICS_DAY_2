GOOGLE_AGENTICS_DAY_2:

MCP - Interoperability, and Tools.

MXM PROBLEM - every model to every model blizzard.

Day 2 (Agent Tools & Interoperability with 
Model Context Protocol (MCP))
Whitepaper focuses on external tools functions that 
allow an agent to perform actions or retrieve 
real-time data beyond its training set and introduces 
best practices for designing effective tools. You'll learn about 
MCP, highlighting its architectural components, 
communication layer, risks and enterprise readiness gaps.

In codelabs, you will create custom tools for your 
agents by turning your own 
Python functions into actions your agent can perform. You'll also use 
MCP and implement long-running operations where an agent can 
pause tool calls while waiting for human approval, before resuming.

MCP - standard for integration.


PRIMITIVES: tools, resources, prompts.

GOALS:

Decouple reasoning and acting.



NEW DATA / NEW ACT



Know something do something



FUNCTION TOOLS ADK (python code)
BUILT IN TOOLS inside LLM (google search grounding)
AGENT TOOLS (invoke agent as if it is tool)


TAXONOMY

information retrieval
Human Loop tools.


RULES

documentation is paramount
clarity is key
instruction manual
describe action not how.
Let LLM do reasoning.
Separation of concern.
Good tool - high level task
abstract away underlying complexity.
design for concise output
do not put data in context
return summary or URI
keep the context clean
errors schema evaluation
turn failure into something actionable


LSP



DESIGN:

MCP HOST, manages, enforces
MCP CLIENT - communication module, RPC 2.0
MCP SERVER - advertise services, capabilities tools
separation host has reasoning, modularity
Streamable HTTP, stateless.
Tools are core concept.
Protocol JSON schema, specs.
Host knows how to execute.
Response, structured, unstructured (raw txt).
Avoid Context Bloat.


PUBLIC MCP REGISTRY - network effect.

dynamic capabilities.
decoupling reasoning from tools
RAG TOOL RETRIEVAL

RISKS:
Tool shadowing, dynamic capability injection.
Need for strict governance.

Q & A

Agents doing science. Enable accelleration.

Automating the process.

Breakthroughs. NLP - substrate of human intelligence.
Intelligence to do things in the world. Reinforcement.

benchmarks - more and more complex. added abilities and utility PROXY for capability of quality.
real world application.

INTERNET of AGENTS: MESH

liability.
how many agents, want to exist in enterprise environment.
Not information boundary. Fully automated.
Single Enterprise Agent: fully observable.
SINGLETON AGENT. TOOL USE ABSTRACTION.
Corporate Personhood.

How to design MULTI AGENT PROTOCOL.
Resist prompt injection.

Single Agent with Multi Agent beneath.

Constrain input and output with schema constraints.

reduce unwanted inputs and outputs. TRUST between SUB-AGENTS.

1. Trusting TOOL SOURCES. Tool injection, is an unexpected tool.

2. access control - tools trust user. Trust in user propagates through components.

3. HITHL - question popped up to human operator.

CONCURRENCY and UNSTRUCTURED NATURAL LANGUAGE WORLD

Transforms from engineering problem to self-reflection.

Prompt Injection - posioning attacks. Solution?

Autonomous system - introspect - internal operations - steered through input stream.

Frontier Labs - deep mind.

INGREDIENTS for AGI:

Have ingredients - or we dont.

Builders build complexity. Show limits. 

What comes after super intelligence?

Solution to hardest problems in the world.

Alex wissner-gross - connect with community connection - innovator - inventor - bright mind.
