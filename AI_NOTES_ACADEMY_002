Day 2:

CONTEXT & PROMPT ENGINEERING

"AI is only as smart as your context."

forward thinking prompting.

skills of staying power.

prompt engineering replaced by

context engineering.

"staking document"
resume task:
set the frame
full in fields
expand and save

FRAME:
why, what, when.
core picture to expand.
win conditions.

recursion - output back in.

FIELD:

staking


teach your tools, 
giving them better instructions, 
references, and structure.

We’ll focus on building prompts 
that work across writing, visuals, 
and data tasks, 
making AI an actual partner 
in thinking, not just typing.


transform content into tone.

symbolic analogy.

save file for use.

seeding gene-splicing

prompting is code.

code is like dna.

seed contains dna.
tone, structure, logic
is DNA.

combine documents to get
new species.

staking documents exist as detail.
combine theories, creations.
results in new species.

additive and subtractive

lesson 1 
generate 2 docs
seed - extract logic tone

a mechanizm that
inherits two mechanisms.

upload docs, tweek then save
as new doc.

TOPICS:

Why do two people using the same tool
get totally different results?
What’s one way to make AI responses 
more “you”?
What’s the difference between 
instructing and collaborating with AI?

TASK

writer or planner or researcher!
make a researcher!
add perspective!

build library of tools.

combine two files into researcher.

field frame to create two
documents. to generate
a new persona.


Design one advanced prompt for a 
real-life workflow, for example:

- A job recruiter using AI to 
draft candidate summaries
- A designer using AI to generate 
style references
- A marketer using AI to 
analyse customer feedback
