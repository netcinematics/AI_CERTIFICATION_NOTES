whitepaper provides a technical guide to the operational lifecycle of AI agents, 

focusing on deployment, scaling and productionization. 

It explores the challenges of transitioning agentic systems from prototypes to 

enterprise-grade solutions, with special attention to A2A Protocol.  

codelabs, how to build systems of multiple, independent agents that can 

communicate and collaborate using A2A Protocol.
