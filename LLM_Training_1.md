### LLM Training Skills (RLHF):
value pairs,
reward shaping,
agent as judge,
    - fact checking
    - RLHF - ranking different AI responses: helpful or accurate.
    - Red Teaming - finding logical holes or biases in AI logic.


### AI Define vocabulary:

O - Red teaming:
O - Over fitting:
O - catastrophic forgetting,
O - training collapse,
O - gradient descent
O - softmax
O - Relu, Peft, qlora, LoRA
O - sigmoid
O - CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU
O - cross entropy
O - backpropagation
O - feed forward layers
O - linear layers.
O - inference time
O - CoT tracing, logging
O - Data Vis (Interpretability dashboards):


O - video 1
O - video 2
O - LLM video


### AI suggestions:
- aiming for apex performance.
O - translate vocabulary to alignerr ecosystem.


### AI roleplay

Q: How do you handle models output meets technical requirements, but fails the brand voice or safety alignment in a production environment?

A: Follow Iterative Alignemnt process, sequence and strategy best-practices. trace failure back through pipeline, from prompt down to fine-tuning dataset - to identify where "semantic drift" occurs

O then design a creative remedy, to counteract the semantic drift, and retrain the model.


Q: why are you a top preformer?

A: 26 years experience in technical architecture, I've developed a high-bandwidth informaiton assimilation process.Where assessments are a great opportunity to apply 10,000+ hours of research to modernize existing skills into advanced deliverables. I can manage a high volume of concurrent projects, because I operate at a nexus of technical math and creative abstraction.
