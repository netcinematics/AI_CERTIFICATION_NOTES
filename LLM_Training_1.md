### About me

- subject matter expert, to train/align AI models - across specialist roles.
- WebGL and GIS experiences with Matrix Math background, is a major differentiator.
- "I dont just understand weights and activation functions, I see them as high-dimensional spatial transformations."
- " My WebGL visual/spatial intelligence allows me to perform profound abstraction inference. I often visualize latent space of a model, to identify where a models logic may be brittle or spatially inconsistents or mathematically flawed."
- enterprise production experience give ability to QA (quality assure) temporal consistency of models, video, audio (prosody, timing), lighting, color, motion, etc.
- rigor and vigor, . 
Embedding space visualization Innovation.
- esxsentially a teacher. a systematic leearner. Paying forwared knowledge.
- passion for data visualization (any chart 2D,3D, infographics)
- specialty in visualizing latent space of AI models, and their relationships.
- take pride in data transformations, translations, and curation, and visualization pipelines.
- Interests, AI, Math, Finance, Web3, Finance, Economics, Cinema, Audio, Video, Animation, History, Philosophy, 


### Teaching career - humans:
- university trained artificial intelligence.
- post graduate tokenizer in C++ for LLM and linguistics specialization.
- Spealty in "Semantic drift" solutions, by understanding of ambiguity, cliche, polysemy, and homonymy.
- techstars, davinci institute, 
- encode academy, genai academy
- stanford Web3 & AI member,
- CU Boulder AI by Hand member.
O - Thinkful - full stack app developer / mentor ~ 1000 students, Socratic Method.


### Last minute reminders:
- Repeat the question.
- Stay on topic.
- evaluate and switch to best practice naturally.
- Dont say "UM", "I dont know", or "Like".
- REpeat the question beginning and the end. 

### RED TEAMING SKILLS:
- shifts from "breaking systems", to "breaking logic".
O - "Adversarial Linguistics": semantic jailbreaking: frame a query to bypass furardrails O O - (persona adoption, context shift, or hypothetical scenarios).
O - "Heuristic Analysis: compare/contrast model outputs for systemic bias/logical drift.
O - Precision Research:  find the edge of training data, ask questions the model hasnt seen.
O - "Holistic Oversight": 
O - "Full lifecycle Architect: inception to production experience.
O - "Cross-functional Integration: depth and breadth of knowledge.
O - "Systematic Methodology: 
O - "Methodical Reasoning: 
O - "Holistic Reasoning: 
O - High-Fidelity Granularity: precision and attention to detail without losing big picture.
O - Heuristic Agile Learner: system of learning to rapidly adapt new information.



### LLM Training Skills (RLHF):
value pairs,
reward shaping,
agent as judge,
    - fact checking
    - RLHF - ranking different AI responses: helpful or accurate.
    - Red Teaming - finding logical holes or biases in AI logic.

O - translate vocabulary to alignerr ecosystem.


### AI roleplay

Q: How do you handle models output meets technical requirements, but fails the brand voice or safety alignment in a production environment?

A: Follow Iterative Alignemnt process, sequence and strategy best-practices. trace failure back through pipeline, from prompt down to fine-tuning dataset - to identify where "semantic drift" occurs

O then design a creative remedy, to counteract the semantic drift, and retrain the model.


Q: why are you a top preformer?

A: 26 years experience in technical architecture, I've developed a high-bandwidth informaiton assimilation process.Where assessments are a great opportunity to apply 10,000+ hours of research to modernize existing skills into advanced deliverables. I can manage a high volume of concurrent projects, because I operate at a nexus of technical math and creative abstraction.
